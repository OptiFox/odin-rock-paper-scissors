# The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Overview

This repository contains my solution for the rock-paper-scissors project by The Odin Project, mainly to train my basic understanding of JavaScript

## Features

This page contains the following:

* **getHumanChoice():** A prompt will appear to ask the user for their input (rock/paper/scissors).
* **getComputerChoice():** It uses the Math.random() function of JavaScript, which will then output (rock/paper/scissor) based on the value it generated.
* **playRound():** This will make sure the input is case insensitive, and then using if-else to decide the winner, then calculate the scores.
* **playGame():** This loops the playRounds() function for more rounds of gameplay.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the main page layout.
* **JavaScript:** For an interactive web experience.
